### here is the pipe line used with this machine learing issue:

+ first:

## reading the data :

## read X_test y_test .. X_train y_train .. activity_labels .. features .. subject 

+ second:

## binding the train and test datasets to one data set for every tow similar set.

## => make : 1- X set .. 2- y set (id) .. 3- y set (name)"by indexing the every id in y_id to its label" .. 4- subject .

+ third: 

## extracting  the requeired data (cols) from "X set" . and asigne it to "Data"

## and bind the y set to Data too.
